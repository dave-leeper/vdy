The first reviews were brought in from my Yelp ad and my Google Business page. All of my initial reviews have been imported exactly as they were written and I'm unable to edit them. As for my replies, I make mistakes, yes, I'm human, so I'm able to edit my replies. Thanks so much for being here and I hope you like my reviews.\n\nVince","id":"text:1"}]
